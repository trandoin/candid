            <h2 style=" font-family: Arial, Helvetica;font-weight:900">CANDID MISSION</h2>
            <p>Importance of education actually describes the importance of our mission because, our mission is related with the education. Education is an important human activity. It was born with the birth of the human race and shall continue to function as long as the human race lives.</p>
            <p>Education is an essential human virtue. Man becomes ‘man’ through education. He is what education makes him. It has been rightly said that without education, man is a splendid slave, reasoning savage.</p>
            <span id="more3">  <p>Education is necessary for society. Education brings into focus the social aspect of man. Education signifies man’s supreme position in society.</p>
            <p>An individual is made up of different entities. Education brings about the integration of these separate entities. Education teaches what man lives and struggles for. It cultivates an integrated life.</p>
            <p>Education is a sign of superiority. Aristotle wrote, “Educated men are as much superior to uneducated as the living are to the dead.”</p>
            <p>Education is a sign of freedom. Epictetus had declared, “Only the educated are free.”</p>
            <p>Diogenes felt that “Education is a controlling grace to the young, consolation to the old wealth to the poor and ornament to the rich.”</p>
            <p>Education is an essential basis of good life. A man becomes a human being in the real sense when he is transformed from primarily an animal being into a human being.</p>
            <p>In short, education is an essential concomitant of all human societies. “What sculpture is to a block of marble, education is to the soul”, says Addison</p>
            <p>The utmost importance of education for the humans has inspired us to set our mission.</p>
            <h6>Mission CANDID !!</h6>
            <p>“ To Impart quality education with utmost honesty, accuracy, precision and focus is the key focus as the part of our mission. Taking the goals of students as our mission is something which makes us work hard. Enlighten the minds concepts and pouring in the values is part of our mission.”</p>
